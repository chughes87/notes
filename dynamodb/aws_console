Can only name a table on creation
    Need to create a new table and transfer data to rename

Primary key should be as varied as possible
    String type has more possible values among the key types

Number is a good sort key for obvious reasons

Can not delete local secondary indexes once created!
    Need to really think about what our local secondary indexes are going to be**

Projected Attributes ** review later
    decide which item attributes apart from partition and sort key we want to store in this particular index
    affects the size of the index

Filters are ALWAYS applied AFTER performing the query
    Therefore will not affect the RCUs consumed
